            <p class="p1">Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international racing
                for
                open-wheel
                single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The
                FIA
                Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of racing since its inaugural
                running in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must
                follow.
                A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in
                multiple
                countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads."</p>
            <p class="p2"> Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to very
                high
                cornering
                speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, much of which is generated by
                front
                and rear wings. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control,
                launch control, and automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994.
                They
                were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively
            </p>
            <p class="p3">With the average annual cost of running a team—designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay,
                transport—at
                approximately £220,000,000 (or $265,000,000),[2] Formula One's financial and political battles are
                widely
                reported. The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity
                firm CVC Capital Partners for £6.4 billion ($8 billion).[3][4]</p>
            <p class="p4">Beginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's
                commercial
                rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now
                is.[23][24] When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One
                Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president.[25] Previously, the circuit owners
                controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams
                to
                "hunt as a pack" through FOCA.[24] He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take
                or
                leave. In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside
                advertising.[23]

                <h2>Histori</h2>


                <p class="p5">The formation of the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1979 set off
                    the
                    FISA–FOCA war, during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with FOCA
                    over
                    television revenues and technical regulations.[26] The Guardian said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley
                    "used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view". FOCA threatened to
                    establish a
                    rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races.[23] The result
                    was
                    the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given
                    reasonable
                    notice of new regulations.[27] Although FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the
                    administration of those rights.[28]</p>

                <p class="p6">FISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983.[29] But by then,
                    turbocharged
                    engines, which Renault had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were
                    essential to
                    be competitive. By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi)
                    pressure, estimated[who?] to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix.
                    The
                    next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW (1,100 bhp), with boost pressure limited to only
                    4.0
                    bar.[30] These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit racing cars ever. To reduce engine
                    power
                    output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in 1984, and boost pressures in 1988,
                    before
                    banning turbocharged engines completely in 1989.[31]</p>


                <p class="p7">On the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham was
                    also
                    competitive during the early 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with Nelson Piquet. Powered
                    by
                    Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won 16 championships (seven constructors' and nine
                    drivers')
                    in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford, Honda, and Renault to also win 16 titles
                    (nine
                    constructors' and seven drivers'). The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became
                    F1's
                    central focus during 1988 and continued until Prost retired at the end of 1993. Senna died at the
                    1994
                    San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The
                    FIA
                    worked to improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger
                    also
                    died in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at
                    the
                    wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, where Jules Bianchi
                    collided
                    with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying nine months later from his
                    injuries.
                    Since 1994, three track marshals have died, one at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix,[35] one at the 2001
                    Australian Grand Prix[35] and one at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.
                </p>
                <p class="p8">Formula One originated from the World Ma8nufacturers' Championship (1925–1930) and
                    European
                    Drivers'
                    Championship (1931–1939). The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow.
                    Formula
                    One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix
                    in
                    accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's
                    official
                    start.[5][6] Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a
                    new
                    championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the
                    conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become
                    effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.[7]</p>



                <p class="p9">A point-system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for
                    the drivers,
                    and
                    one for the constructors (the teams). Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class
                    of
                    racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on grade one tracks, the highest grade
                    rating
                    the
                    FIA issues for tracks.</p>

                <h2>Alfa Romeo 159</h2>
                <p class="p10">A Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite being
                    regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula
                    One championship.[10] Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and
                    third the other three times.[11][12] Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered—still the record for
                    the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver.[13] National championships
                    existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula
                    One events for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in
                    1983.[14][15]</p>
                <p class="p11">This era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari,
                    Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo's 158, which were
                    front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated
                    engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful
                    cars, due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars.[16][17] When a new Formula One formula
                    for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated for the 1954 world championship, Mercedes-Benz
                    introduced its W196, which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as
                    desmodromic valves, fuel injection, and enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the
                    championship for the next two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due
                    to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.[18][19]</p>
                <p class="p12">The first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone
                    Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950.[8] Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the
                    first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won
                    the championship in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957.[9] This set the record for the most World
                    Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won
                    his sixth championship in 2003.[9]</p>
